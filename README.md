# RepairCoin

## What is RepairCoin?

RepairCoin is a dual-token ecosystem revolutionizing the repair industry through blockchain-based loyalty rewards (RCN) and decentralized governance (RCG). Powered by FixFlow.ai, it creates a transparent, cross-shop rewards network where customers earn tokens for repairs and shops benefit from tiered pricing based on their governance token holdings.

---

## 🌍 Mission

To build the first community-governed loyalty ecosystem for the repair industry, where shops with higher RCG stakes receive better RCN pricing, creating aligned incentives between platform success and participant rewards.

## 🔐 Token Economics

### RCN (RepairCoin) - Utility Token
- **Supply Model**: Unlimited minting capability
- **Fixed Value**: 1 RCN = $0.10 USD at all shops
- **Token Flow**: Admin → Shops → Customers → Burned
- **No Trading**: Internal ecosystem only, not on exchanges

### RCG (RepairCoin Governance) - Governance Token
- **Total Supply**: 100 Million RCG (fixed)
- **Purpose**: Platform governance and shop tier benefits
- **Minimum Stake**: 10,000 RCG to become partner shop
- **Lock Period**: 6 months minimum after activation

### Customer Earning Structure
- **Small Repairs ($50-$99)**: 10 RCN base + tier bonus

- **Referral Rewards**: 25 RCN (referrer) + 10 RCN (referee) after first repair
- **Daily Limit**: 50 RCN per customer
- **Monthly Limit**: 500 RCN per customer

### Customer Tier System

- **Gold** (1000+ RCN lifetime): +30 RCN bonus per repair

### Shop Tier System (RCG-Based)
| Tier | RCG Required | RCN Price | Investment | Benefits |
|------|--------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Standard | 10K-49K | $0.10 | ~$5,000 | Basic platform access |

### Stripe Webhook Setup

RepairCoin uses Stripe webhooks to automatically process shop subscription events. Follow these steps to set up webhook testing locally:

#### 1. Install Stripe CLI
```bash
# macOS
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Windows (via Scoop)
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe

# Linux
wget -O stripe.tar.gz https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/latest/download/stripe_*_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf stripe.tar.gz
sudo mv stripe /usr/local/bin/
```

#### 2. Login to Stripe
```bash
stripe login
```

#### 3. Start Webhook Forwarding
```bash
# Forward Stripe webhooks to your local backend
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Copy the webhook signing secret from the output (starts with whsec_)
# Add it to your .env file as STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

#### 4. Test Webhook Events
```bash
# Trigger a test subscription event
stripe trigger customer.subscription.created

# Trigger payment success
stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded

# View webhook logs
stripe logs tail
```

#### 5. Verify Setup
- Check backend logs for webhook processing
- Visit `/api-docs` and test webhook endpoints
- Monitor `webhook_logs` table in database
- Use Stripe Dashboard to view webhook delivery status

#### Important Environment Variables
```bash
# Required in .env file
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...          # From Stripe Dashboard
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...        # From stripe listen command
STRIPE_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_...      # Your subscription price ID
STRIPE_MODE=test                       # Use 'live' for production
```

#### Production Webhook Setup
For production deployment:
1. Create webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
2. Set URL to `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events: `customer.subscription.*`, `invoice.*`
4. Copy webhook signing secret to production environment

Attracts more shops → Higher RCN sales → Better RCG staker yields →
More RCG investment demand → Cycle accelerates
```

This creates aligned incentives where:
- Shops benefit from lower costs as they invest more
- RCG holders benefit from platform growth
- Customers benefit from a larger network
- Platform benefits from sustainable revenue
