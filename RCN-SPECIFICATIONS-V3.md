## Technical Integration

### Smart Contract Functions
```solidity
mint(address to, uint256 amount) // Admin only
burn(uint256 amount) // On redemption
transfer(address to, uint256 amount) // Standard ERC-20
balanceOf(address account) // Check balance
```

### FixFlow CRM Webhooks
- `repair_completed` - Triggers RCN earning
- `referral_verified` - Processes referral rewards
- `tier_bonus_applied` - Adds tier bonuses

### API Endpoints (Backend Implementation)
- `POST /api/tokens/mint` - Mint RCN to customer
- `POST /api/tokens/verify-redemption` - Validate redemption
- `GET /api/tokens/earned-balance/{address}` - Get earned balance
- `POST /api/shops/{shopId}/purchase-rcn` - Shop buys RCN

## Development Priorities

### Phase 1: RCG Foundation (Next 3 months)
1. Deploy RCG governance token
2. Implement staking platform
3. Create DAO voting system
4. Set up revenue distribution

### Phase 2: RCN Integration (Months 4-6)

2. Integrate RCG requirements in shop registration
3. Implement automated revenue distribution
4. Deploy production RCN contract

### Phase 3: Full Launch (Months 7-9)

## API Integration Guide

### For Developers
```javascript
// Check shop's RCG tier
const tier = await getShopTier(shopAddress);

// Calculate RCN purchase price
const price = tierPrices[tier]; // 0.10, 0.08, or 0.06

// Process shop RCN purchase
await processShopPurchase(shopId, rcnAmount, tier);

// Distribute earnings to RCG stakers
await distributeRevenue(totalRevenue);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Update CLAUDE.md with RCG integration requirements
2. **This Week:** Plan RCG token deployment specifications
3. **This Month:** Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. **Q4 2025:** Complete dual-token ecosystem launch
