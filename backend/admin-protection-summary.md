# Admin Protection & Multi-Super Admin Support Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend - Admin Service Enhancement
- **File**: `/backend/src/domains/admin/services/AdminService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - `getAllAdmins()` now adds `isProtected` property for admins in ADMIN_ADDRESSES
  - `getAdminProfile()` includes `isProtected` status
  - Role is dynamically set to `super_admin` for all env admins
  - Protected admins cannot be deleted or modified

### 2. Frontend - AdminsTab Component
- **File**: `/frontend/src/components/admin/tabs/AdminsTab.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `isProtected` property to Admin interface
  - Actions column now checks `isProtected` instead of just `isSuperAdmin`
  - Role display checks both `isSuperAdmin` and `role === 'super_admin'`
  - Added shield icon indicator for protected admins
  - Edit and Delete modals prevent modification of protected admins

## How It Works

### Protected Status
- Any admin whose wallet address is in `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` environment variable is marked as "Protected"
- Protected admins:
  - Cannot be edited
  - Cannot be deleted
  - Show "Protected" label in actions column
  - Display shield icon next to their name
  - Always show as "Super Admin" role

### Dynamic Role Display
- All addresses in `ADMIN_ADDRESSES` automatically show as "Super Admin"
- This works regardless of how many addresses are in the list (1, 2, or more)
- The role is enforced both in backend responses and frontend display

### Visual Indicators
1. **Shield Icon**: Shows next to name for protected admins
2. **Purple "Super Admin" Badge**: Displayed for all super admins
3. **"Protected" Label**: Shown in actions column instead of edit/delete buttons

## Testing
To test with multiple super admins:
1. Set `ADMIN_ADDRESSES=0xAddress1,0xAddress2,0xAddress3` in `.env`
2. All three addresses will:
   - Be recognized as super admins
   - Show "Super Admin" role
   - Be protected from editing/deletion
   - Have full administrative permissions

## Security Benefits
- Environment-configured admins cannot be accidentally removed
- Super admin status is preserved for all env admins
- Clear visual distinction between protected and regular admins
- Prevents privilege escalation by modifying env admins
