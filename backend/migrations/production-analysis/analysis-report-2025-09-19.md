# Production Database Analysis Report
Generated: 2025-09-19T05:20:15.208Z

## Current Production State
- Total tables: 13
- Database appears to be an older version

## Data Summary
customers: 12 records
shops: 5 records
transactions: 0 records
referrals: 0 records


## Production-Only Tables
- admin_logs: Legacy admin logging
- earning_transactions: May need to migrate to transactions table
- wallet_registrations: May need to migrate to customers table

## Missing Critical Features
1. Admin system (admins, admin_activity_logs)
2. Stripe integration (all payment tables)
3. Promo codes system
4. RCG governance token support
5. Modern subscription system

## Migration Strategy
1. Backup all existing data
2. Add missing columns to existing tables
3. Create new tables for missing features
4. Migrate data from legacy tables
5. Update application code to use new schema

## Risk Assessment
- LOW: Adding new tables (no impact on existing)
- MEDIUM: Adding columns to existing tables (app compatibility)
- HIGH: Modifying column types (requires careful testing)

## Recommended Approach
1. Take full database backup
2. Test migration on staging environment
3. Schedule maintenance window
4. Apply migration with rollback plan ready
5. Verify all features post-migration
