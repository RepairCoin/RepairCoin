# RepairCoin - Simple Startup Guide

## ✅ What You Already Have Working

Your setup is actually in great shape! You have:
- ✅ Backend API running (health check works)
- ✅ PostgreSQL database  
- ✅ Docker containers working
- ✅ Contract deployed on Thirdweb: `0xd92ced7c3f4D8E42C05A4c558F37dA6DC731d5f5`
- ✅ Good environment configuration

## 🔧 Quick Fixes Needed

### 1. Fix the "pause status" warnings (2 minutes)

Replace the `isContractPaused()` method in your `TokenMinter.ts` with the fixed version from the artifact above. This will eliminate those warnings.

### 2. Test your current API (1 minute)

```bash
# Test customer registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/customers/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"walletAddress": "0x761E5E59485ec6feb263320f5d636042bD9EBc8c"}'

# Test customer lookup  
curl http://localhost:3000/api/customers/0x761E5E59485ec6feb263320f5d636042bD9EBc8c
```

## 🚀 Create Frontend (15 minutes)

### Option A: Next.js (Recommended)
```bash
# In your project root
npx create-next-app@latest frontend --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir

cd frontend
npm install thirdweb
```

### Option B: Plain React (Simpler)
```bash
# In your project root  
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
cd frontend
npm install thirdweb
```

Then copy the wallet component from the artifacts above.

## 📝 Your .env is Perfect!

Your `.env` example is actually excellent. Just fill in:
1. `THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` - from your Thirdweb dashboard
2. `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY` - from your Thirdweb dashboard  
3. `PRIVATE_KEY` - your wallet private key (without 0x)

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Step 1: Fix Backend Warnings (5 min)
1. Apply the TokenMinter fix from the artifact
2. Restart your containers: `docker-compose restart`

### Step 2: Create Simple Frontend (15 min)  
1. Run the frontend setup commands above
2. Copy the Next.js components from artifacts
3. Add your Thirdweb credentials to `.env.local`

### Step 3: Test Token Flow (10 min)
1. Connect wallet in frontend
2. Register as customer
3. Test minting via API
4. Check balance updates

### Step 4: Add Real Functionality (Later)
1. Connect to FixFlow webhooks
2. Add shop registration
3. Implement redemption flow

## 🔍 Database Service Question

You're right that `DatabaseService.ts` is long (800+ lines). In production, you'd split it:

```
services/
├── CustomerService.ts     (customer operations)
├── ShopService.ts        (shop operations)  
├── TransactionService.ts (transaction logging)
├── WebhookService.ts     (webhook processing)
└── DatabaseService.ts    (core DB connection)
```

But for MVP, keep it as-is. It works and you can refactor later.

## 🎯 MVPβ vs Full Product

**MVP (Next 2-3 days):**
- ✅ Customer wallet (view balance, register)
- ✅ Manual token minting (admin)
- ✅ Basic dashboard
- ✅ Docker deployment

**Full Product (Later):**
- FixFlow webhook integration  
- Shop registration & approval
- Cross-shop redemptions
- Mobile optimization
- Production deployment

## 🚨 Critical: Your Contract Methods

Since you deployed via Thirdweb, your contract might have different method names than my `.sol` file assumed. Check your contract on [BaseScan](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xd92ced7c3f4D8E42C05A4c558F37dA6DC731d5f5) to see what methods it actually has.

Common Thirdweb contract methods:
- `mintTo(address, uint256)` - for minting
- `balanceOf(address)` - for balance
- `totalSupply()` - for total supply
- May not have `pause()` functions

## ⚡ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# 1. Fix backend (apply TokenMinter fix first)
docker-compose restart

# 2. Create frontend  
npx create-next-app@latest frontend --typescript --tailwind --app
cd frontend && npm install thirdweb

# 3. Test everything
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Should see clean logs without pause warnings

# 4. Start building!
```
